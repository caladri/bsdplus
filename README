BSD+ is a set of library and utility additions intended for BSD-like systems,
particularly FreeBSD, implemented in the spirit of BSD.

It is hoped that it will serve as a useful incubator for useful utilities and
APIs and help drive BSD innovation.  Hobbyist participation is
strongly-encouraged and while it is curated slightly for quality and
appropriateness, the goal is to include tools from a variety of sources and for
numerous purposes.  From system administration helpers to text processors and
some light niche-specific tools and libraries.

Where appropriate, it is hoped that mature and generally-useful or
particularly-innovative tools will be merged into the base system of BSD-like
operating system projects.
